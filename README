Monarch - Dominion Simulator

Author: Bryant Ferguson

Dependencies: c++11, c++stl, make
Build: "make"

Description:
This is some basic framework (incomplete implementation) for a Dominion 
simulator a physical card game designed by Donald X. Vaccarino.

Dominion is a deck building card game for 2 - 4 players.

From the rule book:
"You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant
kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes
and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and
a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion!"

Basic overview of game play:
Players start with a deck of 10 cards, drawing 5 of them during game setup
and after each turn. During the game, they will collect treasure and kingdom
cards from a pool of cards to increase the utility of their deck (and "dominion"). 
The game ends when all provinces have been collected, or 3 piles of pool cards
have been exhausted. Whoever has the most points from victory points on
cards in their deck, wins the game.

Goal of this project:
* Create an extensible simulator with interchangeable player implementations.

Future goals:
* Automatic player with file configurable strategies. (not hard coded)
* AI player with machine learning.
* Implementation of all cards and mechanics of the Dominon.  
* A full human player interface.
* Create interface to an online implementation so that it may be
  programatically driven by the player implementations from this project.
